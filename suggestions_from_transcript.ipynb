Because a store, they obviously tells you that the web URL is an online store, similar to how a dot agency would very, very clearly without an iota of doubt, tell somebody that it's an agency. So that's sort of the synergies that we have. And we've seen that reflect in the numbers that we've seen across the COVID bump that happened two years ago. And even in general, right? We have about 800,000 users on Dockstore, over the second highest selling domain on Shopify. So obviously people do realize that sort of thing, but that being said, awareness is a major, major challenge for our brand, right?

We're looking for an agency to completely handle end to end account management for our TikTok account, right? We have an agency doing it in the past, which was based in the UK. Didn't obviously work as well for us, otherwise we would have continued. We ended up growing the account on the back of paid acquisition, but we're looking at a more organic strategy and just coming from the fact that, you know, everybody tells us that TikTok has this sort of inherent ability for growth and they have this ability to, you know, give you the hockey stick, where suddenly you're at 10K and the next day you're at a million. So that's what we want to explore. We want to eventually be able to, obviously viral hits are like one hit wonders, but we're hoping to get a more sustained, better performance on TikTok organically, as opposed to currently where we are at, which is at about 200, 300 views per video. And at the end of this call, I was hoping if you guys could, you know, help me with the code or with at least some strategic direction with respect to how you guys see yourselves managing this account. And just want to clarify that this is going to be end to end account management, right? It's going to be strategy creation, conceptualization, execution, including posting and post account analytics and things like that. Only because we're based in the wrong geography and we're targeting people based in North America, but we're based in Dubai or in India. So obviously none of us can handle the accounting for it. So we need somebody else who's based in the US or Canada that should be to handle this for us. \",\n",

We tried a more e-commerce centric content format, which was more providing people tips and tricks or tools that will help an online business owner grow and content, which was value adding with the aim that if you provide content, which is value giving, that probably people will want to follow you back for the value you offer. So we tried that out first for about two months or so and more recently we sort of pivoted to a broader sort of business approach, which was more anything under the sun, but with a sort of overlay of business, right? So for example, we would create memes and you'll see instances of this on the account, right? So we would create memes of people just doing random things overlaid with a business sort of code or like put out motivational stuff from celebrities like Jim Carrey or Zendaya and then add like a business flavor to it by contextualizing with either descriptions or captions or things like that. So we've tried both of those. If you would ask my personal opinion in terms of why this didn't work, I think it was more of the style or the format of the execution as opposed to the actual content buckets themselves. I still see value in the content buckets. I think what failed us was the execution of the concept, not the concept itself. \",\n",

It wasn't that every day we had a content piece going up. It was more when the agency was able to shoot and post, which was okay for us considering it was 20. But then when the frequency dropped to about 12, that's where it got a little challenging, right? Because then it became extremely inconsistent \",\n",

So we tried to do essentially more awareness led paid media, which was targeted towards one single content piece, which was very high value, which we pushed to a lot of our followers, sorry, a lot of the paid audits and tried to get more awareness out of it. And the other was obviously like a follower acquisition strategy that we used. So we did experiment with paid media and to be completely upfront, we are going to continue to push money down the paid channel. It's just that we don't want that to interfere with the content that we create with the agency. Because we'd much rather explore the organic value that TikTok has to offer too. We've already seen value on the paid side and we are going to double down on it. But we don't wanna confuse that goal with the agency's goal of the organic acquisition, which is also what we wanna explore. \",\n",

I know a lot of brands just focus on getting sort of leads or getting people to buy their products. That's not our focus. Our focus is more awareness led, which is why what we're doing is trying to create assets or pieces that people can remember and things that will leave like a mark on their mind so that whenever they have the need for a domain name, they go into GoDaddy or Namecheap or whatever registrar looking for us. So that's sort of the goal is slightly different. It's more awareness led. If it were conversion led, then I think what you're saying makes perfect sense. You should create an asset which performs best in ads and just run that and sort of hit your goals. But since our goal is more awareness led, this format of working with influencers and then pushing that on paid sort of works a little better, we figure. \",\n",

And it's just the two of us who will be making the decision in terms of who to go ahead with. And as soon as we make the decision, the contractual obligations are fairly less. We don't have a legal... I mean, we do have a legal team, but it's not so that we need to run this by them every time, unless there is something that's really sort of catching our eye and is disturbing. Only then do we involve that. Otherwise, we sort of take the decision on contracts and everything else. So we should be able to do it extremely quickly. It should take no more than two to three days on our side, which is why I said this timeline is doable from the perspective of our internal working. If of course, you guys are able to quote in time and give us at least a couple of content buckets, I'd say. We're not looking for a proper strategy or a PPP deck or a template or anything of that sort. But we would like to understand the direction that you folks would take with respect to the account. And this is only coming from the bad experience we've had in the past. Had we had a more positive experience, we would have probably been more open to just taking a risk and see where this goes. But since we had an experience where we ended up creating content and it was almost like throwing spaghetti on the wall, right? Something will stick, something will work. So that's not the approach we want to take. We want to go along with a more structured strategy, at least in terms of a rough directional content bucket from your folks. \",\n",

Guys, don't worry about it. We'll be around to sort of like work all the time. Because like I said, this is literally crunch time, right? We need to get this going, get this off the ground, extremely quickly. Like right now, it's about 7.15pm my time here. I really don't mind taking late evening or early morning calls if I have to for this instance until we get kicked off. Once we do get kicked off, we'd rather have like a more stable timeline that we set forward because obviously this is not sustainable for four months.

So that's why I think budget here is going to be key. So if you can send that out like say tomorrow, and then once we align on the budget, we can probably then it would make more sense for you guys to even put effort on the buckets. I don't want your time to also sort of like go to waste. So it just makes sense for you guys to send over a proposal in terms of the costing.
